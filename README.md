# adventOfCode
Advent of code attempts from 2021 onward. 

Rust was the language of choice for 2021 and 2022 because I want to practice it. 

Code for each day is in a separate source file and is then imported into main. Inputs (and test inputs) are saved in the inputs folder for each cargo project. 

## running
If you have cargo installed, simply go to the aoc202X folder and then use cargo run to build and execute that particular year's code.
