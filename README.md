# adventOfCode
Advent of code attempts from 2021 onward. 

- 2021 in R
- 2022 & 2023 in Rust
- 2024 in Go 


## running the rust implementations
Code for each day is in a separate source file and is then imported into main. Inputs (and test inputs) are saved in the inputs folder for each cargo project. 

If you have cargo installed, simply go to the aoc202X folder and then use cargo run to build and execute that particular year's code.
